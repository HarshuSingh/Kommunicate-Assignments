The best project I’ve worked on is the Exploratory Data Analysis - Terrorism. It was the project which is on Data Science Domain in which i have used Python and ml models to predict the values which gives the real time values.  I have done this project when i was doing my data science intern in one company. 
As a security/defense analyst, try to find out the hot zone of terrorism and also perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘Global Terrorism’.
