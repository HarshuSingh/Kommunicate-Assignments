The two people I will choose from my batch if I start a software company will be - Aryan Tiwari (RA1911003030011) & Raj Singh (RA1911003030018) because we have already worked on some projects to help each other out and we also are proficient in our own domains like Aryan Tiwari is well skilled at data science and machine learning and Raj Singh also knows a lot about the Frontend part and react part too. As a software company requires the latest technology, we are well equipped with the skills required to manage and run the company smoothly.
